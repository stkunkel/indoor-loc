/*
7.1 Antenna Delay
The antenna delay may need changing if a different antenna is being used.
Note: If the antenna delay value is set too large, it results in negative RTD calculation results (internally to
the software) and these RTD values are discarded as bad and no RTD / distance measurement will be
reported. In using the system, if the communication seems to be working, but the time-of-flight status lines
are not updating, then this may be because the antenna delay is set to too large a value. This can be
checked by clearing the antenna delays to zero. To tune the antenna delay to the correct value is a process
of trial and error, tweaking the antenna delay until the average distance reported matches the real antenna-
to-antenna distance measured with a tape measure.
