 *  @brief   Single-sided two-way ranging (SS TWR) initiator example code
 *
 *           This is a simple code example which acts as the initiator in a SS TWR distance measurement exchange. This application sends a "poll"
 *           frame (recording the TX time-stamp of the poll), after which it waits for a "response" message from the "DS TWR responder" example
 *           code (companion to this application) to complete the exchange. The response message contains the remote responder's time-stamps of poll
 *           RX, and response TX. With this data and the local time-stamps, (of poll TX and response RX), this example application works out a value
 *           for the time-of-flight over-the-air and, thus, the estimated distance between the two devices, which it writes to the LCD.

/*****************************************************************************************************************************************************
 * NOTES:
 *
 * 1. The single-sided two-way ranging scheme implemented here has to be considered carefully as the accuracy of the distance measured is highly
 *    sensitive to the clock offset error between the devices and the length of the response delay between frames. To achieve the best possible
 *    accuracy, this response delay must be kept as low as possible. In order to do so, 6.8 Mbps data rate is used in this example and the response
 *    delay between frames is defined as low as possible. The user is referred to User Manual for more details about the single-sided two-way ranging
 *    process.
 * 2. The sum of the values is the TX to RX antenna delay, experimentally determined by a calibration process. Here we use a hard coded typical value
 *    but, in a real application, each device should have its own antenna delay properly calibrated to get the best possible precision when performing
 *    range measurements.
 * 3. The frames used here are Decawave specific ranging frames, complying with the IEEE 802.15.4 standard data frame encoding. The frames are the
 *    following:
 *     - a poll message sent by the initiator to trigger the ranging exchange.
 *     - a response message sent by the responder to complete the exchange and provide all information needed by the initiator to compute the
 *       time-of-flight (distance) estimate.
 *    The first 10 bytes of those frame are common and are composed of the following fields:
 *     - byte 0/1: frame control (0x8841 to indicate a data frame using 16-bit addressing).
 *     - byte 2: sequence number, incremented for each new frame.
 *     - byte 3/4: PAN ID (0xDECA).
 *     - byte 5/6: destination address, see NOTE 4 below.
 *     - byte 7/8: source address, see NOTE 4 below.
 *     - byte 9: function code (specific values to indicate which message it is in the ranging process).
 *    The remaining bytes are specific to each message as follows:
 *    Poll message:
 *     - no more data
 *    Response message:
 *     - byte 10 -> 13: poll message reception timestamp.
 *     - byte 14 -> 17: response message transmission timestamp.
 *    All messages end with a 2-byte checksum automatically set by DW1000.
 * 4. Source and destination addresses are hard coded constants in this example to keep it simple but for a real product every device should have a
 *    unique ID. Here, 16-bit addressing is used to keep the messages as short as possible but, in an actual application, this should be done only
 *    after an exchange of specific messages used to define those short addresses for each device participating to the ranging exchange.
 * 5. This timeout is for complete reception of a frame, i.e. timeout duration must take into account the length of the expected frame. Here the value
 *    is arbitrary but chosen large enough to make sure that there is enough time to receive the complete response frame sent by the responder at the
 *    6.8M data rate used (around 200 �s).
 * 6. In a real application, for optimum performance within regulatory limits, it may be necessary to set TX pulse bandwidth and TX power, (using
 *    the dwt_configuretxrf API call) to per device calibrated values saved in the target system or the DW1000 OTP memory.
 * 7. dwt_writetxdata() takes the full size of the message as a parameter but only copies (size - 2) bytes as the check-sum at the end of the frame is
 *    automatically appended by the DW1000. This means that our variable could be two bytes shorter without losing any data (but the sizeof would not
 *    work anymore then as we would still have to indicate the full length of the frame to dwt_writetxdata()).
 * 8. We use polled mode of operation here to keep the example as simple as possible but all status events can be used to generate interrupts. Please
 *    refer to DW1000 User Manual for more details on "interrupts". It is also to be noted that STATUS register is 5 bytes long but, as the event we
 *    use are all in the first bytes of the register, we can use the simple dwt_read32bitreg() API call to access it instead of reading the whole 5
 *    bytes.
 * 9. The high order byte of each 40-bit time-stamps is discarded here. This is acceptable as, on each device, those time-stamps are not separated by
 *    more than 2**32 device time units (which is around 67 ms) which means that the calculation of the round-trip delays can be handled by a 32-bit
 *    subtraction.
 * 10. The user is referred to DecaRanging ARM application (distributed with EVK1000 product) for additional practical example of usage, and to the
 *     DW1000 API Guide for more details on the DW1000 driver functions.
